# WebP Optimizer

A Python tool that converts images to WebP format with optimized compression settings for web use. WebP offers superior compression while maintaining high image quality, making it ideal for websites and web applications.

## Features

- Converts common image formats (PNG, JPG, JPEG, TIFF, BMP) to WebP
- Three optimization levels:
  1. Balanced Mode (80% quality) - Recommended for most uses
  2. High Quality (90% quality) - For quality-critical images
  3. Maximum Compression (60% quality) - For smallest file size
- Preserves transparency in PNG images
- Batch processing of multiple images
- Simple command-line interface

## Requirements

- Python 3.6 or higher
- Pillow library
