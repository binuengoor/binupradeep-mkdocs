> "Action is the best antidote to anxiety."

> "The magic you're looking for is in the work you're avoiding."

## On Discipline and Choices

The path to growth often requires discipline and making difficult decisions:

> "Hard choices, easy life. Easy choices, hard life." - Jerzy Gregorek

> "We must all suffer from one of two pains: the pain of discipline or the pain of regret. The difference is discipline weighs ounces while regret weighs tons." - Jim Rohn

> "Discipline is the highest form of self-love"

Sometimes, success comes down to how we view and handle life's challenges:

> "I don't skate through life, I walk through life in really nice shoes" - Alexis Rose (Schitt's Creek)

> "I do think a key to success in any walk of life is having a short memory and a thick skin - I know it has served me well over the years." - Aubrey McClendon
