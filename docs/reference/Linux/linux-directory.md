# Linux Directory Structure Tools

A collection of commands and tools for exploring and visualizing directory structures in Linux.

## Tree Command
Displays directory structure in a tree-like format:
```bash
sudo apt install tree -y

tree                     # Current directory
tree -L 2               # Limit to 2 levels
tree -d                 # Directories only
tree -h                 # Include file sizes
```

Example output:
```
.
├── documents
│   ├── work
│   └── personal
├── downloads
└── pictures
    ├── 2023
    └── 2024

6 directories
```

## List Command (ls)
Traditional directory listing:
```bash
ls -R                   # Recursive listing
ls -la                  # Detailed list with hidden files
ls -lh                  # Human readable sizes
```

Example output:
```
drwxr-xr-x 4 user user 4.0K Dec 22 10:30 documents
drwxr-xr-x 2 user user 4.0K Dec 22 10:30 downloads
drwxr-xr-x 4 user user 4.0K Dec 22 10:30 pictures
```

## Find Command
Search and explore directories:
```bash
find . -type d          # List all directories
find . -type f          # List all files
find . -maxdepth 2      # Limit search depth
```

Example output:
```
.
./documents
./documents/work
./documents/personal
./downloads
./pictures
./pictures/2023
./pictures/2024
```

## Advanced Usage: File Content Explorer
View directory structure with file contents:
```bash
tree -if --noreport | while read file; do
    if [ -f "$file" ]; then
        echo "=== $file ==="
        cat "$file"
        echo
    fi
done
```

Example output:
```
=== ./config.yml ===
server:
  port: 8080
  host: localhost

=== ./readme.md ===
# Project README
This is a sample project...
```

## Common Options

- `-a`: Show hidden files
- `-h`: Human readable sizes
- `-L n`: Limit depth to n levels
- `-d`: Directories only
- `-f`: Full path prefix

These tools are invaluable for system administration, documentation, and understanding directory hierarchies.
