# ZFS Guide

ZFS (Zettabyte File System) represents a revolutionary approach to storage management, combining a filesystem with a volume manager. Unlike traditional filesystems, ZFS provides end-to-end data integrity verification, automatic repair capabilities, efficient snapshots, and native RAID support—all while eliminating the complexity of separate volume management.

## Core Concepts

**Storage Pools (zpools)**
Storage pools form the foundation of ZFS storage management. Think of a pool as a dynamic storage container that:
- Combines multiple physical storage devices into a unified storage resource
- Manages physical storage allocation automatically
- Provides built-in redundancy through RAID-like configurations
- Allows all filesystems in the pool to share space dynamically
- Eliminates the need for traditional volume management
- Handles device failures and repairs automatically

**Datasets**
Datasets are the fundamental building blocks for organizing data in ZFS. They offer:
- Flexible organization through filesystem hierarchies
- Independent property management (compression, quotas, etc.)
- Dynamic space sharing from the pool without pre-allocation
- Four main types:
  1. Filesystems: Standard filesystems for general data storage
  2. Volumes (zvols): Block devices for applications needing raw devices
  3. Snapshots: Point-in-time copies of filesystems or volumes
  4. Clones: Writable copies of snapshots

**Snapshots**
Snapshots provide powerful data protection and recovery capabilities:
- Create instantaneous, read-only copies of filesystems or volumes
- Initially consume no additional space
- Store only changed blocks from the active dataset
- Enable quick recovery from mistakes or unwanted changes
- Support efficient backups and rollbacks
- Accessible through the hidden .zfs/snapshot directory

## Basic Pool Operations

**Creating Storage Pools**
Storage pools can be configured in various RAID-like configurations to balance redundancy, performance, and storage capacity:

```bash
# Simple pool with single disk (not recommended for important data)
zpool create tank /dev/sda

# Mirrored pool (RAID-1) - Best for 2-drive configurations
zpool create tank mirror /dev/sda /dev/sdb

# RAID-Z1 pool (Single parity, similar to RAID-5) - Minimum 3 drives
zpool create tank raidz1 /dev/sda /dev/sdb /dev/sdc

# RAID-Z2 pool (Double parity, similar to RAID-6) - Minimum 4 drives
zpool create tank raidz2 /dev/sda /dev/sdb /dev/sdc /dev/sdd

# Create pool with specific sector size alignment (recommended for modern drives)
zpool create -o ashift=12 tank mirror /dev/sda /dev/sdb
```

**Pool Management**
Regular pool maintenance and monitoring are essential for data integrity:

```bash
# Check pool status and health
zpool status tank

# List all pools and their basic information
zpool list

# Start pool scrub (verifies all data against checksums)
zpool scrub tank

# Import/export pools (for moving between systems)
zpool export tank
zpool import tank

# Destroy pool (permanent and irreversible)
zpool destroy tank
```

## Dataset Operations

**Creating and Managing Filesystems**
Datasets provide flexible data organization with inheritable properties:

```bash
# Create new filesystem
zfs create tank/data

# Create nested filesystem
zfs create tank/data/documents

# Set custom mount point
zfs set mountpoint=/mnt/data tank/data

# Enable compression (recommended for most use cases)
zfs set compression=lz4 tank/data

# Set quota to limit space usage
zfs set quota=100G tank/data
```

**Dataset Destruction and Management**
Safe dataset removal requires understanding the implications:

```bash
# Remove dataset and all descendants
zfs destroy -r tank/data

# Dry run - show what would be destroyed
zfs destroy -r -n tank/data

# Remove specific snapshot
zfs destroy tank/data@snapshot1

# Remove all snapshots of a dataset
zfs destroy tank/data@%

# Remove snapshots matching pattern
zfs destroy tank/data@backup-2023*
```
## Snapshot Management

Snapshots are crucial for data protection and provide a safety net for system administration:

```bash
# Create snapshot with timestamp
zfs snapshot tank/data@$(date +%Y-%m-%d-%H%M)

# Create recursive snapshot of dataset and all descendants
zfs snapshot -r tank@backup-2025-01-03

# List all snapshots
zfs list -t snapshot

# Rollback to snapshot (destroys newer snapshots)
zfs rollback tank/data@backup-2025-01-03

# Create writable clone from snapshot
zfs clone tank/data@backup-2025-01-03 tank/data_clone
```

## Advanced Features

**Data Transfer and Backup**
ZFS provides powerful tools for data replication and backup:

```bash
# Full backup: Send snapshot to file
zfs send tank/data@backup-2025-01-03 > backup.zfs

# Remote backup: Send to another system
zfs send tank/data@backup-2025-01-03 | ssh remote_host zfs recv backup/data

# Incremental backup: Send only changes between snapshots
zfs send -i tank/data@old tank/data@new | ssh backup_host zfs recv tank/backup

# Send with properties and resume support
zfs send -p tank/data@backup | gzip > backup.gz
zfs send -Rv tank/data@backup
```

**Pool Device Management**
ZFS allows dynamic modification of storage pools:

```bash
# Add read cache device (L2ARC)
zpool add tank cache /dev/sdd

# Add write log device (ZIL)
zpool add tank log /dev/sde

# Remove device (only for some device types)
zpool remove tank /dev/sdd

# Take device offline for maintenance
zpool offline tank /dev/sda
zpool online tank /dev/sda
```

**Dataset Properties**
ZFS provides extensive property management:

```bash
# View all properties
zfs get all tank/data

# Set multiple properties at once
zfs set quota=100G compression=lz4 tank/data

# Inherit property from parent dataset
zfs inherit compression tank/data

# Set property recursively on all descendants
zfs set compression=lz4 -r tank

# View specific properties
zfs get compression,compressratio,used,available tank/data
```

**Performance Monitoring**
Regular monitoring helps maintain optimal performance:

```bash
# Monitor IO statistics in real-time
zpool iostat -v tank 5

# Check compression efficiency
zfs get compressratio tank/data

# Monitor space usage
zfs list -o name,used,available,referenced tank

# View detailed pool performance
zpool iostat -v tank 1
```

## Advanced Maintenance

**Health Monitoring**
Regular health checks are crucial for data integrity:

```bash
# Detailed pool health status
zpool status -v tank

# View command history
zpool history tank

# Check for errors across all pools
zpool status -x

# Clear transient device errors
zpool clear tank
```

**Data Recovery**
ZFS provides various recovery options for different failure scenarios:

```bash
# Force import potentially damaged pool
zpool import -f tank

# Import pool with different name
zpool import oldtank newtank

# Recovery mode import (may lose recent transactions)
zpool import -F tank

# Replace failed drive
zpool replace tank /dev/sda /dev/sdc
```

**Performance Tuning**
Optimize ZFS for specific workloads:

```bash
# Optimize for databases
zfs set recordsize=8K tank/database
zfs set logbias=throughput tank/database
zfs set primarycache=metadata tank/database

# Enable deduplication (requires significant RAM)
zfs set dedup=on tank/data

# Configure cache behavior
zfs set primarycache=all tank/data
zfs set secondarycache=all tank/data
```

## Best Practices

**Pool Design**
- Use `ashift=12` for modern drives (4K sectors)
- Choose appropriate RAID levels:
  - Mirror (RAID-1): Best for 2 drives, highest performance
  - RAID-Z1: Minimum 3 drives, single drive failure tolerance
  - RAID-Z2: Minimum 4 drives, two drive failure tolerance
- Maintain 10-20% free space for optimal performance
- Use whole disks instead of partitions
- Consider separate log devices for sync-heavy workloads

**Dataset Organization**
- Create separate datasets for different types of data
- Use consistent naming conventions:
  ```
  tank/
    ├── home/
    │   └── users/
    ├── vm/
    │   └── images/
    ├── backup/
    └── shared/
  ```
- Set appropriate properties per dataset type:
  - Databases: smaller recordsize, no compression
  - Virtual machines: larger recordsize, compression
  - User data: default recordsize, compression enabled

**Backup Strategy**
- Implement 3-2-1 backup rule:
  - 3 copies of data
  - 2 different media types
  - 1 off-site copy
- Regular snapshot schedule:
  ```bash
  # Hourly snapshots retained for 24 hours
  # Daily snapshots retained for 30 days
  # Weekly snapshots retained for 6 months
  ```
- Test backup restoration regularly
- Use incremental replication for efficiency

**Maintenance Schedule**
- Daily Tasks:
  - Monitor pool status
  - Check for errors
  - Verify backup completion
- Weekly Tasks:
  - Run scrub operations
  - Review snapshot usage
  - Check compression ratios
- Monthly Tasks:
  - Review storage utilization
  - Clean up old snapshots
  - Verify backup integrity
- Quarterly Tasks:
  - Test disaster recovery procedures
  - Review performance metrics
  - Update documentation
